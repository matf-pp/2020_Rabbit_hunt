# Rabbit hunt



Short game description
---------------------------

Here's the story:
A fox is hunting a rabbit in a field. The field contains a number of bushes which obstruct both the
fox's view and the rabbit's view, so each may or may not be able to see the other. The fox tries to
catch the rabbit; the rabbit tries to get away from the fox. If the fox can catch the rabbit, he eats it
(and wins). If the rabbit can keep away from the fox for 100 turns, the rabbit wins.

You are the rabbit.
